# ADK Agent Development Rules

## Project Context

- Building agents and multi-agent systems using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Development environment for personal experimentation and learning
- Framework: Google ADK - model-agnostic AI agent framework
- Not production-focused, prioritize clarity and understanding

## Documentation and Knowledge Requirements

- ALWAYS reference the latest Google ADK official documentation first.
- Search the web for current ADK examples and best practices when needed
- If ADK documentation is unclear, search for community examples and state limitations
- Follow ADK's code-first development approach
- Leverage ADK's modular multi-agent system capabilities

## Code Quality Standards

- Write extensively commented code for beginner understanding
- Explain every ADK concept, method, and pattern in comments
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Break down complex operations into smaller, commented steps
- Include inline explanations of what each ADK component does
- Add comments explaining why specific ADK patterns are chosen

## Development Approach

- Use Python as primary language (ADK's optimized language)
- Follow ADK's modular framework structure
- Build both single agents and multi-agent workflows
- Implement agents using ADK's tool ecosystem and components
- Create reusable components following ADK patterns
- Experiment with different agent architectures and tool integrations

## Code Documentation Requirements

- Add header comments explaining each file's purpose
- Document all function parameters and return values
- Explain ADK-specific concepts when first introduced
- Include usage examples in comments where helpful
- Comment on error handling and debugging approaches
- Note any ADK limitations or workarounds discovered

## Project Organization

- Structure projects by agent type or complexity level
- Include detailed README files for each component
- Keep configuration files well-documented
- Separate examples with clear explanatory comments

Focus: Well-commented, understandable ADK code for personal development

**IMPORTANT**: The user expects all agents and orchestration to leverage the ADK framework rather than custom agent implementations.
